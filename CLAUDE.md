# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Quintra** — a top-down action roguelike for Game Boy Color, native CGB, written in C with GBDK-2020. Pure roguelike (only knowledge persists), 5 monster-human classes, procgen rooms every run, rest-room saves only, item-driven builds (no XP grinding). Heavy Penta Dragon mechanical influence (bullet-hell projectile patterns, form-energy mechanics) crossed with Zelda LA / FF Adventure / Ultima ROV (top-down maze exploration, items as permanent character expansions).

**The novelty layer:** all *dev-host* tooling and content authoring is in Rust under `tools/`. The C runtime is the only thing that ships on cart. Typed Rust content schema catches invalid items/enemies/biomes at `cargo build`, never at runtime. The seam is `src/generated/`.

**Lineage:** this project pivoted from being a Penta Dragon DX clone (now under `archive/penta-dragon-dx/`) to a Penta-inspired-but-original game. The Penta-clone effort is preserved for reference but is not built or shipped.

**Current Status:** v0.2.0 — Phase 1 scaffolding complete. Boots in CGB mode, displays a colored background. Rust tooling workspace builds cleanly.

### Toolchain

- **GBDK-2020 v4.5.0** at `~/gbdk` (C runtime)
- **SDCC 4.5.1** (included with GBDK)
- **Rust stable** (host-side tooling only — never compiled into ROM)
- Compiler driver: `~/gbdk/bin/lcc`

### Why a Rust tooling layer?

Rust cannot target GBC's Sharp SM83 CPU — no LLVM/GCC backend exists. Game runtime *must* be C. But Rust shines on the host side for content authoring: typed schemas, compile-time invariant checking, deterministic procgen reference impls, automated asset processing. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-quintra-engine-design.md` for the full architecture.

## Common Commands

### Build

```bash
make            # cargo codegen → SDCC → rom/working/quintra.gbc
make clean      # clean C build
make cleangen   # wipe src/generated/
make cleanall   # nuke everything
make info       # print build summary
```

### Test / Play

```bash
make test       # build + headless mGBA + screenshots (Phase 3+)
make play       # build + launch mGBA-qt for human testing
```

### Rust tooling

```bash
cd tools
cargo build --release             # build all crates
cargo test                        # run all Rust tests
cargo run -p quintra-codegen      # regen src/generated/ from content/
cargo run -p quintra-assets       # PNG → tile data (Phase 2+)
cargo run -p quintra-mgba         # mGBA debug TUI (Phase 3+)
```

### Cart spec
- **MBC5 + RAM + battery** (cart type 0x1B)
- **2 MB target** (currently building 512KB; bumps `-Wl-yo` as banks fill)
- **32 KB SRAM** (4 × 8KB banks)
- **CGB only** (`-Wm-yC` enforces)

### Memory layout

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-quintra-engine-design.md` §2 for the full bank/WRAM/SRAM plan. High-level:
- Banks 0–7: hot engine code (always resident)
- Banks 8+: warm/cold content + per-biome data
- WRAM `$C100`: 32-slot entity table (768 B)
- WRAM `$C400`: player state
- SRAM 0: suspend save; SRAM 1: meta-progress; SRAM 2: stats

### Build flow

1. `cargo run -p quintra-codegen` reads `content/*.rs` → emits `src/generated/*.{c,h}`
2. `cargo run -p quintra-assets` processes `assets/` → tile/sprite C arrays
3. SDCC compiles `src/**/*.c` (including generated) → `rom/working/quintra.gbc`

The Makefile chains these. `cargo build` failures fail the whole build — no ROM is emitted if content is invalid.

## Development conventions

### C runtime
- Plain GBDK-2020 idioms: `void main(void)`, `wait_vbl_done()`, `SHOW_BKG`, etc.
- Typedefs in `src/core/types.h`: `u8/i8/u16/i16/u32/i32`, `fix8_t` for 8.8 fixed point
- Typed IDs (`class_id_t`, `item_id_t`, etc.) — opaque newtypes, opaque to C
- `BANKED` keyword for far-bank functions
- `__addressmod` far pointers for cross-bank data reads
- One cross-bank far call per frame stage; no nested banking

### Rust tooling
- 2021 edition, MSRV 1.75
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` in all crates
- Container types with `&'static [T]` skip serde (hand-authored Rust consts only)
- Leaf scalars (enums) keep serde for future RON support
- Validation always before emit: orphan ID, oversize table → cargo build fails

### Spec-first
- New systems get spec entries before code — see `docs/superpowers/specs/`
- Spec is source of truth for memory layout, bank plan, RPG numbers

## Testing

### Headless (preferred for automation)
- `make test` boots ROM in headless mGBA + screenshots (Phase 3+)
- Save-state anchors at title / mid-combat / rest-room / boss for fast regression
- NEVER launch mgba-qt GUI during automated testing (KDE Wayland)
- ALWAYS clean stray Xvfb procs: `pkill -9 -f 'Xvfb :'`

### Rust unit tests
- `cargo test` — content validation, procgen determinism, codegen output
- xorshift32 determinism is pinned by test — the on-cart C impl must match

### mGBA MCP
- When available, prefer MCP `mgba_*` tools over CLI subprocess

## Penta Dragon DX archive

The original Penta-DX colorization effort lives in `archive/penta-dragon-dx/`. Reference for:
- Original color palette designs (`palettes/`)
- Reverse-engineering notes (`reverse_engineering/`)
- Save states from OG gameplay (`save_states_for_claude/`)
- Working VBlank colorizer architecture (in case we revisit)

It does not build or ship as part of Quintra.

## Legal Notice

The repository does NOT include any original ROM. The Penta DX archive uses ROMs the user supplied legally. Quintra is wholly original — no original Penta assets are used in the new game.
