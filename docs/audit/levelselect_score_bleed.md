# Level-select / high-score screen "color bleed" — root cause (2026-06-14)

## Symptom
The "STAGE 01 / STAGE LOAD / ◆ TOP 3 / 1ST 9999 SEC …" screen shown when you pick
**GAME START with a save present** has orange/red color bleed on the big "STAGE
NN" letters (same tile shows palette 0 AND palette 1 on different cells).

## Root cause (verified)
- This screen is the **level-select** routine `bank1:0x7393` (reached via
  `JP NZ 0x7393` at `0x3B47` when `DCFD != 0`). Its scene byte is **D880=0x00**
  (same as the title menu / boot / ending graphic) and **FFC1=0**.
- It draws the letters with the **direct tilemap writer (tile IDs only, no CGB
  attribute)** and runs its **own input loop (`0x73C3`) with interrupts disabled**
  for the STAT-wait draws — so the **DX VBlank colorizer never runs while it is
  on screen** (probe: cleaner sentinel `DF08` stays `0x00` for 50+ frames; only
  re-arms at ~f270 when the screen is leaving).
- Therefore the letter cells keep whatever BG attributes were last written there
  (by the title banner / prior gameplay via the inline hook) → same tile, mixed
  p0/p1 → bleed.
- **Confirmed**: manually clearing the attr plane (VBK=1, 0x9800-0x9FFF=0) on this
  screen makes the letters uniform p0. So the fix is "clear attrs here".

## Why it's hard
- The screen is colorizer-dark (own DI'd loop), so all colorize-handler /
  scene_detect-side fixes (which run in our VBlank chain) do NOT reach it. (My
  D880=0x18 splash fix and a D880=0x00 cleaner re-arm both missed it for this
  reason — the only verified win so far is the *OPENING START* brief "STAGE NN"
  splash at D880=0x18, a different screen.)
- A real fix must inject an attr-plane clear into the level-select path itself
  (e.g., repoint `JP NZ 0x7393` through an LCD-off attr-clear, then JP 0x7393).
- **No free space in bank 0 or bank 1** (both packed; largest single-byte runs
  are tile data, not padding; the previously-noted "0x431C gap" is actually a
  STAT-wait copy loop). The clear routine must live in a mapped bank (0 or 1) to
  be reachable from the level-select, so injection requires reclaiming bytes from
  existing code/data — careful, verifiable, but risky.

## Note
OPENING START (DCFD==0) bypasses the level-select and is clean. The bleed is
only on the GAME-START/continue path.
