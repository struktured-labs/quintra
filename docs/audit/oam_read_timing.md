# mGBA Lua OAM read timing — resolved (and the real bug it uncovered)

**Resolution 2026-06-18:** the "per-byte drift in 40-slot loop" theory was
WRONG. Switched dump_oam to `emu:readRange(0xFE00, 0xA0)` (atomic block
read returning a string). That eliminated my probe-vs-runner discrepancy,
which then revealed a **real game-side issue**: Sara's HW OAM slot 1 attr
ALTERNATES between pal 2 (Sara W, correct) and pal 6 (Gargoyle, wrong)
every few frames during the gargoyle_miniboss save.

**Hard evidence:** dump-every-frame trace on
`level1_sara_w_gargoyle_mini_boss.ss0` over 1166 frames showed slot 1 attr
= 0x02 in 490 frames and 0x06 in 676 frames (≈42/58 split). Slot 0/2/3
all stayed at pal 2. Only slot 1 alternates.

This is the same kind of alternation pattern we documented for boss arena
BG attrs (`project_arena_position_sweep.md` — Sara's right-half OBJ slot
gets the boss palette written by ??? mid-frame). The screenshot still
shows Sara as predominantly peach/pink because:
1. LCD renders one specific frame's HW OAM; ~42% chance that snapshot is
   the correct pal2 frame.
2. Persistence-of-vision averages the alternating sprite colours, so the
   user perceives "slightly purple-tinged peach" rather than "flickering
   between peach and blue-gray".

## What's confirmed

1. **Visual = correct.** Screenshot-pixel sampling of `gargoyle_miniboss.png`
   at game coords (72,64)-(88,80) shows (247, 173, 90) peach + (74, 8, 0)
   dark red + (16, 16, 0) near-black. Those match Sara W's OBJ palette
   (`OBP2 = 0000 2EBE 511F 0842`). They do NOT match BGP6/OBP6 (blue-gray
   ~165,165,181).

2. **Single-slot probe = correct.** A focused probe reading ONLY slot 0
   and slot 1 attr at frame 60 (via `-t` state load + same Lua "frame"
   callback timing as the test runner) reports `slot0=0x02 slot1=0x02`
   consistently across f60/62/65 (`/tmp/match_test_runner.log`).

3. **40-slot dump = WRONG.** The test runner reads ALL 40 OAM slots in a
   loop (160 sequential `emu:read8` calls per sample). At frame 60+ in
   gargoyle save, slot 1 attr comes back as `0x06` (boss palette).

## Hypothesis

`emu:read8` is not atomic relative to the emulator core's frame loop —
between iterations of the OAM dump, the core may advance scanlines, and
the game's main-loop OAM rebuild can update HW OAM mid-dump. Slot 0 gets
read at LY=144 (post-recolor), slot 1 gets read at LY=145+ where the game
has had time to overwrite slot 1's attr.

The consensus filter (5 samples in frames 58–68) does NOT fix this because
each sample suffers the same mid-dump drift in the same way — majority
vote across 5 identical-bias samples still loses.

A pre-read busy-loop also doesn't help (the drift is during the dump,
not before it).

## What we ruled out

- Lua `emu:loadStateFile` vs `-t` state-load: both produce the same OAM
  behaviour at frame 60+ in single-byte probes.
- Frame-callback timing relative to VBlank IRQ: LY=144 at callback fire,
  which is post-IRQ — single reads are clean.
- The colorizer logic: trace through `bg_experiment.py.create_tile_based_colorizer`
  for tile 0x25 goes `CP 0x30 carry → low_tiles → CP 0x20 NC → sara_palette`
  → A = D (Sara form palette) = 2 for Sara W. No path produces pal 6 for
  this tile sequence.

## What was fixed (test harness)

- `dump_oam` in `scripts/run_color_regression.py` switched from a 40-slot
  loop of `emu:read8` calls to a single `emu:readRange(0xFE00, 0xA0)`
  block read + Lua string indexing. This is the **atomic block-read
  primitive** mGBA Lua exposes; eliminated the per-byte drift hypothesis
  and made probe results reproducible.

## What's NOT fixed (real game bug — future iteration)

Sara's OAM slot 1 alternation in boss fights. Root cause: somewhere in
the boss-fight path, slot 1's attr gets written to pal 6 (the gargoyle
boss palette E value) when it should stay pal 2 (Sara W form's D value).

## Iteration 3 findings (2026-06-18)

Deep probe at frames 250-400 (when HW slot 1 alternates) reveals the
ACTUAL flow:

- **Shadow A slot 1 attr**: pal 2 ALL frames (colorizer correctly paints
  Sara palette in shadow buffer A at C007).
- **Shadow B slot 1 attr**: pal 2 ALL frames (same for shadow buffer B
  at C107).
- **HW OAM slot 0**: pal 2 ALL frames (consistent with shadow).
- **HW OAM slot 1**: pal 2 OR pal 6, alternating (~42/58 split).

So the colorize handler IS doing its job. The DMA copies clean pal 2 to
HW OAM. **My HW-OAM recolor also writes pal 2.** But BETWEEN my recolor
(end of VBlank IRQ) and the Lua read (start of next frame), SOMETHING
overwrites HW OAM slot 1 attr with 0xFE (= pal 6 + flips + bank + priority
bits set). The "something" is the game's main-loop sprite-rebuild code
running OUTSIDE VBlank — it writes directly to `0xFE07` between IRQs.

The original NOP at `rom[0x06D5]` killed the game's OAM DMA, but there's
STILL a direct-write path somewhere that we missed. ROM-scan for `EA 07
FE` (direct LD [0xFE07], A) returns zero matches, so the write must be
indirect (LD [HL], A with HL set elsewhere — likely a strided OAM-rebuild
loop).

### Fix options

1. **Find and NOP the offending write.** Need mGBA memory watchpoint OR
   instruction-trace at LY != 144 (main loop scanlines). Lua exposure
   limited — may need an emulator-side script.
2. **Add a 2nd recolor pass on every scanline / mode 2 (OAM scan).**
   Triggered by STAT IRQ. Adds complexity + cycles but fixes it
   guaranteed.
3. **Disable the rogue path indirectly.** If the loop is part of
   `gargoyle_logic` (boss-specific), patch the boss-spawn routine to
   skip OAM rebuild.
4. **Live with it.** Persistence-of-vision averages the alternation —
   user perceives "slightly purple-tinged peach" not "flickering between
   peach and blue-gray". Real visual impact is small. Mark known-issue
   and move on.

Option 4 is the lowest-effort, and the user's visual complaint in this
session was about explicit "Sara half-orange" which was a DIFFERENT bug
(the earlier B=40 recolor issue, since fixed). The current alternation
is subtle enough that it may not have been noticed visually.

Recommended next: pursue option 2 (STAT-triggered re-recolor) on a future
iteration when there's a multi-hour window. For now, leave the 9 boss-
save OBJ tests excluded from the hook (they'd be 42/58 flaky against the
real alternation).

Until fixed, the 9 boss-save OBJ tests stay out of the pre-commit hook
because their YAML expectations (Sara=pal2) are objectively correct and
the game IS wrong — but the test would flicker pass/fail with the
alternation. Mark them as `known_flaky_until_alternation_fixed: true`
when widening the hook.

## Iteration 6 finding: same root cause family for non-boss enemies

Probe of `level1_sara_w_orc_healpotion1_poison_cure.ss0` over 491 frames
showed slot 4 (orc body tile 0x05) alternating between pal 0 (362 frames)
and pal 4 (129 frames). The test ACTUALLY fails on slot 12 (orc body tile
0x55 expected pal 5, got pal 0) because the colorizer assigns orc to
slots 10+ where my B=10 recolor doesn't reach — same DMA-race-residue
mechanism as Sara slot 1 in boss fights, just affecting non-Sara
sprites in higher slots.

So the "9 excluded OBJ tests" all share ONE underlying issue:
**sprites past slot 10 don't get re-colored by my HW recolor**, so the
game's main-loop OAM writes (which use default pal 0 or game-chosen pals
that differ from the colorizer's intent) win at LCD draw time.

The cleanest fix is option 2 from above (STAT-IRQ re-recolor — pure
re-stamp during HBlank, no need to expand B which would bring back Sara's
half-orange via slot 10-11 secondary sprites mapping tile 0x10-0x1F to
pal 4). This unifies the fix for ALL 9 excluded tests at once.

## Iteration 7: detailed STAT-IRQ implementation plan

Survey of the existing IRQ vectors (`rom/working/penta_dragon_dx_teleport.gb`):
```
0x0040 (VBlank): C3 D1 06 → JP 0x06D1 (game's existing VBlank handler, our trampoline hooks it)
0x0048 (STAT):   C3 53 08 → JP 0x0853 (ALREADY IN USE — sound/music timing handler)
0x0050 (Timer):  C3 B3 06 → JP 0x06B3 (game's timer / sound engine tick)
0x0058 (Serial): D9       → RETI (unused)
0x0060 (Joypad): D9       → RETI (unused)
```

So STAT can't be hijacked directly — the game has its own handler at 0x0853
(saves all regs, switches to bank 1, does sound work, switches bank back,
RETIs). Our STAT-IRQ re-recolor must CHAIN through it.

### Plan for next iteration(s)

1. **Author `stat_irq_handler` in bank-13 free space** (currently ~33 bytes
   available between 0x7FCD and POSMAP_PTR_TABLE 0x7FE0, plus 14 bytes after
   0x7FF2). Target size: ~30 bytes. Logic:
   ```
   stat_irq_handler:
     PUSH AF
     LDH A, [FFBE]        ; Sara form: 0=W, 1+=D
     OR A
     JR NZ, .dragon
     LD A, 0x02           ; pal 2 = Sara W
     JR .stamp
   .dragon:
     LD A, 0x01           ; pal 1 = Sara D
   .stamp:
     ; Re-stamp slot 1 attr (the dominant alternation slot)
     LD H, A              ; save pal
     LD A, [0xFE07]       ; current slot 1 attr
     AND 0xF8             ; clear pal bits
     OR H                 ; merge new pal
     LD [0xFE07], A       ; write back
     ; Also re-stamp slot 3 (same logic) and slots 10-15 (orc/soldier body)
     ; ... (further stamps via tile-range lookup for non-Sara slots)
     POP AF
     JP 0x0853            ; chain to game's STAT handler
   ```

2. **Patch IRQ vector 0x0048** to JP `stat_irq_handler` instead of 0x0853.
   1-byte change (the low byte of the JP target), but bank-13 is not always
   mapped — the handler must live in a bank that's permanently accessible.
   Bank 0 is always-mapped. Bank 13 is mapped during colorize chain but
   NOT during main loop (which is when STAT fires).
   
   So: install handler in bank 0 free space. Or in WRAM (0xDB00 landing pad
   has space if we move things around). WRAM is bank-agnostic.

3. **Enable STAT mode 0 (HBlank) interrupt**: set bit 3 of STAT register
   (0xFF41). Currently the game might enable STAT only for LYC match or
   mode 1; need to OR in bit 3. One-shot write at boot OR every VBlank.

4. **Performance check**: 144 STAT IRQs per frame × ~30 cycles per handler
   = ~4320 cycles overhead per frame. CGB at single-speed has ~70000 cycles
   per frame, so ~6% overhead. Probably tolerable in mGBA; real-hardware
   measurement needed before claiming OK on MiSTer.

5. **Verification**: rerun gargoyle_miniboss/spider_miniboss_*/moth/mage/
   metal_ball_mage_soldier and all 4 orc/soldier/catfish/orc_with_items
   slot-10+ tests. Expect: all 9 currently-excluded OBJ tests pass.

6. **Hook expansion**: once all 9 pass reliably, add them to
   `scripts/hooks/pre-commit`. Hook goes from 21 → 30 tests, ~70-80s.

Estimated total effort: 2-3 short iterations OR one long focused session.
Risk: the per-scanline overhead could push VBlank+colorize over budget
on real MiSTer hardware (the phantom-sound history shows this is sensitive).
Mitigation: gate the handler on `D880 < 0x16` (only run in dungeon + arena,
not menus/cutscenes) → cuts overhead during attract cycle.

### Bank-0 free space — confirmed location

ROM scan for runs of 0x00 (padding) >= 20 bytes in bank 0 (0x0000-0x3FFF)
found exactly ONE candidate: **0x0838 - 0x0852 = 27 bytes of 0x00**, sitting
IMMEDIATELY before the existing STAT handler at 0x0853. Perfect for a
fall-through prelude: install code at 0x0838, end at 0x0852, byte 0x0853
naturally starts the original handler. No JP-chain needed — saves 3 bytes.

### Prelude byte sequence (25 bytes, fits in the 27-byte window)

```
addr:  bytes               instruction              purpose
0x0838 F5                  PUSH AF                  save A (chain expects clean entry)
0x0839 E5                  PUSH HL                  save HL
0x083A F0 BE               LDH A, [FFBE]            Sara form: 0=W, 1+=D
0x083C B7                  OR A
0x083D 20 04               JR NZ, +4                if dragon, skip to .dragon
0x083F 3E 02               LD A, 0x02               (Sara W → pal 2)
0x0841 18 02               JR +2                    skip dragon path
0x0843 3E 01               LD A, 0x01               (Sara D → pal 1)
0x0845 67                  LD H, A                  H = pal
0x0846 FA 07 FE            LD A, [0xFE07]           current slot 1 attr
0x0849 E6 F8               AND 0xF8                 clear low 3 bits
0x084B B4                  OR H                     merge pal
0x084C EA 07 FE            LD [0xFE07], A           write back
0x084F E1                  POP HL                   restore HL
0x0850 F1                  POP AF                   restore A+F
0x0851 00                  NOP (padding)
0x0852 00                  NOP (padding)
0x0853 ...                 (original STAT handler — fall-through)
```

### Vector patch (1 ROM byte change)

```
0x0049: 0x53 → 0x38       (JP 0x0853 → JP 0x0838)
```

### Caveats to verify in next iteration

1. **Does STAT IRQ fire often enough?** The current STAT trigger (whatever
   it is — possibly LYC or mode 2 for sound timing) might only fire 1-2x
   per frame, which isn't enough to catch every game-write-vs-LCD-read race.
   Test: count STAT fires/frame with a probe.
2. **Does writing 0xFE07 during STAT IRQ break anything?** OAM is accessible
   during mode 0 (HBlank). If STAT fires during mode 1 (VBlank) too, OAM
   write is fine. If during mode 2 or 3, OAM is locked → write is dropped
   (no harm but no benefit).
3. **If STAT IRQ fires too rarely, enable STAT mode-0 bit (0xFF41 bit 3)**
   from the colorize chain — 1-time write at boot to add mode-0 trigger.
   But risk: amplifies STAT call rate from ~2/frame to ~144/frame → may
   break sound timing.

Recommended order for next iteration:
- (a) Install the 25-byte prelude (no STAT enable change).
- (b) Run gargoyle_miniboss test; if pal 6 frequency drops, prelude is
      firing. If it stays at ~58%, current STAT triggers aren't enough.
- (c) If (b) shows need for more triggers, enable mode-0 bit and measure
      phantom-sound risk via the existing D887 watchpoint Lua script.

## What's in the hook now

- 6 BG-table tests (banner/cutscene/splash/postboss/2 arena dispatches)
- 6 OBJ tests on STABLE scenes (non-boss `sara_w_alone`/`sara_d_alone`/
  `crow`/`sara_d_hornet_or_moth`/`jet_form_secret_stage`/
  `spiral_power_active`)
- 12 tests total, ~25-30s wall-clock.
