# D880 — Sound Engine Scene State (NOT the gameplay state machine)

**Updated understanding (this iteration):** D880 is **read by the sound engine
only**. A static cross-bank scan confirms only 2 absolute-mode reads of D880,
both in bank 3 (the sound engine): 0x4029 (the dispatcher analyzed below) and
0x4179. No game-logic subsystem reads D880 directly.

**The actual gameplay-mode flag is FFC1.** 13 read sites across banks 0/1/2
use the classic `F0 C1 A7 ...` (read FFC1; AND A; conditional) gate pattern
that selects between "menu/title (skip)" and "gameplay (run subsystem)".

So the values previously documented for D880 (0x02 = dungeon, 0x0A =
mini-boss, 0x0C-0x14 = stage boss arenas, etc.) describe the **music/sound
mode** the engine selects per scene. The game-state code uses FFC1 + per-
subsystem state bytes (FFBA level counter, FFBD room id, FFBF mini-boss
flag, etc.) to make gameplay decisions.

The two are coupled in practice — game code that transitions scenes
writes both: e.g. `LD A, 0x15; LD (D880), A` (set music to game-start)
followed by `LD A, 1; LDH (FFC1), A` (enable gameplay processing). But
they are accessed independently from there on.

## Consolidates the per-state notes

## Dispatch (revised — verified by full disasm)

The D880 dispatcher at **bank3:0x4029** reads D880, indexes table at
**bank3:0x4A5A**, loads a pointer, and uses the pointed-to **data** to
initialize the **3 sound channels** at D802-D85F + engine state at
D882-D886. Full disasm:

```asm
bank3:0x4029:
    LD A, (D880)
    LD (D881), A          ; D881 = D880 (transition snapshot)
    OR A; JP Z, 0x41F4    ; if state 0, skip
    DEC A; ADD A          ; A = (D880-1) × 2  (16-bit index)
    ADD 0x5A              ; + jump table offset (0x4A5A low byte)
    LD L, A
    LD A, 0x4A; ADC 0     ; high byte 0x4A + carry
    LD H, A               ; HL = 0x4A5A + 2×(D880-1)
    LD A, (HL+); LD H,(HL); LD L,A   ; load 16-bit pointer to scene data

    ; Now HL points to scene data table for this D880 value.
    ; Initialize 3 sound channels at D802/D822/D842
    LD DE, 0xD802; LD B, 3
loop:
    LD A, (HL+); AND 0x07; SWAP A; LD C, A
    RRCA; ADD C; ADD 0x14
    LD (DE), A            ; channel +2 init
    LD A, 0x46; ADC 0
    INC E; LD (DE), A     ; channel +3 init
    LD A, E; ADD 0x1F; LD E, A   ; advance to next channel block (32 bytes)
    DEC B; JR NZ, loop

    LD A, (HL+); LD (D883), A   ; tempo
    XOR A; LD (D882), A         ; clear accumulator
    LD (D885), A; LD (D886), A  ; clear engine status
    ; ... continues with more channel-state init from HL data ...
```

So the **"handlers" in the bank3:0x4A5A jump table are data pointers**,
not code. The dispatcher consumes the data to set up sound channel
state — `marker`, `substate count`, `config`, and the "handler pointers"
in the data table are actually **sound-pattern offsets and tempo
configuration for the scene**.

This **revises the interpretation in `gap_d880_state_08_third.md`** — what
that doc described as "Handler A / Handler B" for combat substates are
actually **pointers to per-channel sound-pattern data**, not code. The
labeling "arena setup / active combat / post-combat" may still be a
useful chronological grouping (substate 0/1/2 representing different
music sections), but the per-handler descriptions are music-driver data,
not direct game logic.

### What the game state machine looks like THEN

The D880 dispatcher's primary job is **scene-specific music init**.
Each scene change (via RST 20 or direct write) triggers a new sound
configuration. The game-state logic (rendering, input, AI) lives
elsewhere — possibly in the bank-3 sound engine's "music has progressed
to new section" callbacks, or in the main loop's other subsystems
(0x0DE9, 0x0E7C, etc.) keyed off D880.

The 4-byte "signature" `05 07 09 89` likely represents the **channel
offset positions** — bytes that determine where in the channel state
block to write specific fields. The constant pattern across states
0x02-0x09 makes sense: all gameplay scenes use the same sound channel
layout; only state 0x01 (title?) differs slightly (`08 07 09 89`).

Plus dynamic writes via **RST 20** (`E7` opcode) from anywhere in the
ROM. Any code with `LD A, <state>; RST 20` will perform an atomic
state change + return from interrupt.

## State handler data table format (verified from rom dump)

Every state 0x01-0x09 handler is a **data table** with this layout:

```
offset  size  field          notes
------  ----  -------------  --------------------------------------
 +0x00   1    marker         0x02 (states 2-9) or 0x03 (state 0x01)
 +0x01   1    substate cnt   2 for most; 3 for state 0x08
 +0x02   2    config         lo byte = 0x01 always; hi byte = duration/timer
 +0x04   4    signature      `05 07 09 89` for states 2-9; `08 07 09 89` for state 0x01
 +0x08   *    handler ptrs   2 handlers per substate (A=render, B=update);
                              16-bit bank3 addresses, repeating
```

### Per-state config + handler dump

| State | Marker | Substates | Config hi | Config interp | Handlers (sub 0)       | Handlers (sub 1)       |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 0x01  | 0x03   | 2         | 0xA5      | 165 frames (title timer?) | 0x4AC6, 0x4AD8     | 0x4B34, 0x4B63         |
| 0x02  | 0x02   | 2         | 0xFA      | 250 frames (scroll cycle)  | 0x4C1C, 0x4C2A     | 0x4CC8, 0x4D42         |
| 0x03  | 0x02   | 2         | 0x8C      | 140 frames     | 0x4E7C, 0x4EE8         | 0x4E92, 0x4FB1         |
| 0x04  | 0x02   | 2         | 0xFF      | 255 (max)      | 0x50E6, 0x50EE         | 0x518D, 0x5222         |
| 0x05  | 0x02   | 2         | 0xFF      | 255 (max)      | 0x53BB, 0x5401         | 0x54C7, 0x557F         |
| 0x06  | 0x02   | 2         | 0xFF      | 255 (max)      | 0x5705, 0x570D         | 0x579E, 0x581F         |
| 0x07  | 0x02   | 2         | 0xFF      | 255 (max)      | 0x61BB, 0x6208         | 0x61C3, 0x6256         |
| 0x08  | 0x02   | **3**     | 0xFF      | 255 (max)      | 0x6398, 0x63A0         | 0x6451, 0x6485 + 0x63AD, 0x645E (substate 2) |
| 0x09  | 0x02   | 2         | 0xC8      | 200 frames (matches DC81 init) | 0x596A, 0x5972 | 0x5A1B, 0x5A85         |

### Config-byte interpretation

The hi byte of config maps to **scene duration / timer initialization**:

- Short cutscenes/transitions: 0x8C (140) — state 0x03
- Title/menu: 0xA5 (165) — state 0x01
- Scrolling section: 0xC8 (200) — matches `DC81 section scroll counter init`
- Normal gameplay scroll cycle: 0xFA (250) — state 0x02 (dungeon)
- Indefinite gameplay: 0xFF (max) — states 0x04-0x08 (interactive combat / boss arenas)

The 0xFF for states 0x04-0x08 means "no built-in timeout" — these are
states the game stays in until an external event (player action, kill,
death, etc.) transitions out via RST 20 or direct D880 write.

### Common signature `05 07 09 89`

The 4-byte signature is identical for all gameplay states (0x02-0x09).
For state 0x01, it differs: `08 07 09 89` (first byte changed). These
bytes are likely **scratch offsets** into a shared substate-handling
substructure (perhaps offsets into the entity-slot block at DC85+,
since DC85 + 0x00 = DC85, +0x07 = DC8C, +0x09 = DC8E, +0x89 — though
this last doesn't map cleanly).

Another interpretation: these are 4 separate offsets into the 16-byte
HRAM block FFE0-FFEF used as state-runtime scratch. Worth tracing a
handler to confirm.

## State 0x08 deep-dive (3-substate combat)

Most-detailed existing state. Uses DDA8 as a substate counter that
cycles 0 → 1 → 2:

| Substate | Handler A | Handler B | Phase                              |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 0        | 0x6398    | 0x63A0    | Arena setup / first-frame render    |
| 1        | 0x6451    | 0x6485    | Active combat (input/AI/damage)     |
| 2        | 0x63AD    | 0x645E    | Post-combat finalize / cleanup      |

Both handlers per substate are called in sequence each tick — A is
typically the "render" pass and B is the "update" pass.

## Connection to v3.01

Our colorize handler's behavior depends on D880 because of the FFC1
gate and the bg_sweep coverage. Specifically:

- **D880 = 0x0C-0x14** (stage arenas): the colorize handler is in
  full effect — attr_computation builds the buffer, GDMA copies to
  VRAM. This is exactly when scroll-tearing artifacts would be
  most visible (boss fights), so the fix matters most here.
- **D880 = 0x02** (dungeon): same handler path applies during
  normal gameplay.
- **D880 = 0x17** (death cinematic): godmode_env handler reverts
  this back to 0x02 for RL training (FFB7 check determines whether
  to allow the cinematic).

## What we still don't know

- Exact handler layout for states 0x03-0x07 and 0x09 (existing notes
  have the data table format but not per-state behavior)
- The role of 0x01, 0x1B, 0x1C states (only their setter addresses
  are known)
- Whether state 0x0B is a real reachable scene or pure transitional

These are tractable via further trace — the dispatch handlers in
bank 3 at addresses listed in the jump table can be disassembled.
