# Penta Dragon HRAM Allocation Map (FF80-FFFE)

Census from static analysis of bank 0 (always mapped). Shows the most-
accessed HRAM bytes, separating reads (consumer code) from writes
(producer code). Documents what we know about each byte's purpose.

## Hardware registers (FF00-FF7F — not strictly HRAM, but accessed via LDH)

## Game state HRAM (FF80-FFFE)

Sorted by descending total access count (bank 0 census). Top entries
are the hottest game-state bytes the engine touches.

| Addr   | R/W     | Purpose                                                  |
|--------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| FFBF   | 19R/2W  | Mini-boss flag (1=Gargoyle, 2=Spider, 3+=spawn-table)    |
| FF94   | 16R/2W  | Joypad EDGE-detected input (from 0x00A8)                 |
| FFBA   | 14R/4W  | Level/boss counter (0-8) — indexes stage boss tables     |
| FFCA   | 12R/3W  | Flag byte — high bit checked via `BIT 7, A` after read  |
| FFE4   | 1R/12W  | **Death cinematic flag** — set to 1 with `RST 28; CALL 0x4944` (per memory + context). Cleared after cleanup. |
| FFC4   | -       | **CENSUS FALSE POSITIVE.** The "writes" counted were operand bytes from `LD DE, $C4xx` immediates (e.g., `11 E0 C4` is `LD DE, $C4E0`, not `LDH (FFC4), A`). Likely unused by vanilla. |

| FFDC   | 9R/2W   | Counter compared against memory (`INC A; CP (HL)` after read) |
| FFEB   | 8R/3W   | Scroll phase toggle (0=normal, 1=alternate/bonus)        |

| FFD1   | ~       | Centisecond counter (0..99) — wraps per second           |
| FFC0   | 22R/41W | State index — read via `LDH A,(FFC0); ADD A,A; ADD A,A; LD B,A` (×4 shift = table offset). Cleared together with DC1B and DCF8. |
| FFCD   | 5R/3W   | 4-state cycle counter — pattern `INC A; AND 3; LDH (FFCD), A` |
| FFD8   | 4R+/3W+ | Status flag read after RST 10 calls                      |
| FFE8   | ~       | Scroll-active flag (gates 0x08F8)                        |

## Our v3.01 additions

| Addr   | Purpose                                                             |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FFE0   | (used as scratch by attr_computation row counter; reused in handler)|
| FFE1   | Used by build_v301_iemask test scripts                              |

Both are in the "TBD" range from the census — no vanilla writes/reads to
these addresses appeared in the bank-0 scan. Safe scratch.

## Census methodology

Counts unique `LDH (n), A` (0xE0 nn) writes and `LDH A, (n)` (0xF0 nn)
reads in bank-0 ROM (0x0000-0x3FFF). Doesn't include accesses from
banked ROM (other banks could push the counts higher) or `LD A, (nn)` /
`LD (nn), A` absolute-mode accesses to HRAM range. For a full picture,
extend the scan to all 16 banks.
