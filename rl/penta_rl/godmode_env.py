"""PentaEnv subclass that injects godmode every tick, uses an explore-heavy reward.

godmode (per tick):
- HP infinite (DCDD/DCDC)
- Corridor timer never expires (DCBB clamped when no boss)
- DD06=0 (release scroll lock)
- DCDF/DCDE max (freeze timer cascade)
- Auto-finish near-death boss
- Death-scene revert (0x17 → 0x02)

Reward additions vs base reward.py:
- unique_room: +50 (was +0.5) — exploration is the primary signal
- arena_enter: +1000 — the goal
- room_change: tiny per change (avoid oscillation farming)
